                <h2> About</h2>
                <p>
                    The horror genre in video games has always been a bit niche. 
                    That said, throughout the years some heavy-hitters have made it to the mainstream. 
                    One of those heavy-hitters, and maybe the biggest franchise in the genre, is Resident Evil.
                    The Resident Evil games were groundbreaking for their time. 
                    The franchise has seen a resurgence thanks to some recent remakes.
                    Other franchises may also follow suit (i.e. Dead Space). 
                    This is a website for fans of horror games, and focuses on the Resident Evil game modern remakes. 
                    "Modern" as in Remakes 2, 3 and 4. 
                    This website will review each of those games.
                </p>
                <h2>Ranking System</h2>
                <p>
                    The three games will be ranked based on gameplay, story, and replay value. 
                    These are broad categories, and ranking is fairly arbitrary. 
                    It's just based on my recent experiences with each game. 
                    These rankings could change with additional subsequent replays.
                    Note that each game is also given an overall score as well. 
                    I have never played the original Resident Evil games.
                    I got into these games with more recent titles, like Resident Evil 7. 
                    So, my gameplay experiences are based on newer Resident Evil/other horror games. 
                </p>
                <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
                <p>
                    Not everyone will agree with these reviews. That's what makes life interesting! 
                    This is my first reviewer website.

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    This game so so fun. It utilizes a great weapon upgrade system that rewards exploration. 
                    The player must weigh the pros of exploration against the cons of running into more zombies (or worse).
                    The environments complimented the gameplay extremely well.
                    My only complaint is the interaction with "SPOILER" Mr. X. 
                    The first few interactions are fun, but it gets old after awhile. 
                    I give the gameplay for this one an 8/10.
                </p>
                <h2>Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        The story is perfect for this type of game. 
                        It borders on cheesy at times, which isn't a bad thing for action horror. 
                        However, the suspense and mystery work well, and 
                        it takes an appropriate amount of time to learn about the zombies. 
                        The final act is also great. 
                        I give the story for this one a 10/10. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Replay Value</h2>
                    <p>
                        The replay value is there. There are 2 characters to play through. 
                        Although the unique sections are fun, there are a lot of repeat sections. 
                        I give this one a 7/10 for replay. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Overall Score: 8/10</h2>

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    In my opinion, the gameplay in Resident Evil 3 is a slight upgrade to the gameplay in its predecessor.
                    The reward systems and gunplay are similar to RE2 Remake, but this time, there is also a dodge ability.
                    The dodge is a simple addition, but it comes in handy and makes movement feel better. 
                    I give this one a 9/10. 
                </p>
                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>
                    The story is a little weaker in this one, mainly because the campaign is shorter. 
                    The mysteries are also less compelling. That said, the characters are great.
                    It's still a good time. 
                    I give this one a 9/10. 
                </p>
                <h2>Replay Value</h2>
                <p>
                    The replay value is about the same as Resident Evil 2 for me. 
                    Although there is only 1 ending, the campaign is short, so replays are easier.
                    I give this one a 8/10.
                </p>

                <h3>"Man, that stinks." - Leon Kennedy</h3>
                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    The Resident Evil 4 remake has the best gameplay. It's more action-oriented than horror, though the horror is there. 
                    However, the guns and fights just feel right. It all comes together for an amazing experience.
                    I give this one a 10/10. 
                </p>
                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>
                    This story is also great. 
                    It's a little convoluted, but interesting and entertaining throughout. 
                    I give this one a 10/10.
                </p>
                <h2>Replay Value</h2>
                <p>
                    The replay value is high, because the first playthough value is high. 
                    It's a lot of fun to revist this game, even if there is only 1 ending. 
                    I give this one a 9/10. 
                </p>
